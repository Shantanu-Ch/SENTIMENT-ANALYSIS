# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

**Objective:**

Predict whether a restaurant review is positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

**Project Overview:**

* Data Preprocessing: Review texts were cleaned using techniques like lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text.

* Feature Extraction: Text data was transformed into numerical representations using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF Vectorizer, enabling the model to process textual input.

* Model Training: A Logistic Regression classifier was trained on labeled review data to predict sentiment categories.

* Model Evaluation: Performance was assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualized with a confusion matrix to understand classification performance.

* Visualization: A word cloud was created to highlight frequently used review words, and evaluation results were visualized to interpret model effectiveness.

**Technical Stack:**

* Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK (or spaCy), Matplotlib, Seaborn

* Techniques Used: NLP preprocessing, vectorization, binary classification, evaluation metrics visualization
